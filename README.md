This project is from the LearnWeb3 Sophomore course. The title is "Launch your own Initial Coin Offering" 

This is a Initial Coin Offering (ICO) project. Crypto Dev (CD) is a new token that is being launched for Crypto Devs. The token will be given out for free to all NFT holders, and other people can buy them for ETH. The total supply of CD tokens will be limited to 10,000.

## Features
- A maximum of 10,000 CD tokens will be available
- Every Crypto Dev NFT holder will receive 10 CD tokens for free, but they will need to pay the gas fees
- The ICO price of one CD token will be 0.001 ether
- A website will be available for users to participate in the ICO

## How to Participate
To participate in the CD token launch, follow these steps:

- Visit the CD ICO website
- Connect your Ethereum wallet
- If you are a Crypto Dev NFT holder, you will automatically receive 10 CD tokens for free
- If you are not a Crypto Dev NFT holder, you can buy CD tokens for 0.001 ether each
- Pay the required gas fees to complete the transaction
